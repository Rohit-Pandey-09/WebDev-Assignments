Q1. What are media queries in CSS and their use case.
Ans1. Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow web developers to create different layouts and styles for different devices and screen sizes. Media queries can be used to specify rules for different media types, such as screen, print, or speech, and different media features, such as width, height, orientation, or resolution. Media queries enable responsive web design, which adapts to the user's device and preferences.


Q2. Difference between min-width and max-width in media queries in CSS.
Ans2. Min-width and max-width are two properties that can be used in media queries to specify the minimum and maximum width of the viewport for which a certain set of CSS rules should apply. For example, min-width: 600px means that the CSS rules inside the media query will only take effect if the viewport width is at least 600 pixels. Similarly, max-width: 800px means that the CSS rules inside the media query will only take effect if the viewport width is at most 800 pixels. Using min-width and max-width together can help create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.


Q3. Explain float property and clear property in CSS with examples.
Ans3. The float property in CSS specifies how an element should be positioned along the left or right side of its container, allowing other elements to wrap around it. For example, if an image has float: left, it will be aligned to the left of its container and the text will flow around it on the right. The clear property in CSS specifies how an element should avoid being adjacent to floated elements on the same line. For example, if a paragraph has clear: both, it will start on a new line below any floated elements on either side of it.
