Q1. What are in-line and block elements in HTML and the difference between them? Name a few inline elementes and block elements.
Ans1. In HTML, there are two types of elements: in-line and block. In-line elements are those that do not start a new line and only take up as much space as they need. For example, <span>, <a>, <img> and <strong> are in-line elements. Block elements are those that start a new line and take up the full width available. For example, <p>, <div>, <h1> and <table> are block elements.
  
  
Q2. How to work with images in HTML and explain in detail <img /> tag important attributes.
  Ans2. To work with images in HTML, you need to use the <img> tag. This tag is empty, meaning it does not have a closing tag. It only contains attributes that specify the image source, alternate text, size, and other options.

One of the most important attributes of the <img> tag is the src attribute, which specifies the path or URL of the image file. For example:
  <img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli" width="500" height="400">

  
  Q3. How to create lists in HTMl?
  Ans3. If you want to create lists in HTML, you have a few options. You can use the <ul> tag for unordered lists, which will show bullets or other markers for each item. You can use the <ol> tag for ordered lists, which will show numbers or letters for each item. You can also use the <dl> tag for description lists, which will show terms and their definitions. Each list item should start with the <li> tag, and you can nest lists inside other lists if you want. Lists are useful for organizing and presenting information on your web page.
  
  
  Q4. How to interlink web pages and navigate people to other web sites ?
  
 Ans4. If you want to link your web pages to each other or to other websites, you need to use HTML links. HTML links are also called hyperlinks and they let users click their way from page to page. To create a link, you need to use the <a> tag with the href attribute that specifies the destination URL. For example:

<a href="https://www.example.com/">This is a link</a>

This will create a link that says "This is a link" and will take you to https://www.example.com/ when you click on it. You can also use an image or any other HTML element as a link by putting it inside the <a> tag. You can also use relative URLs to link to pages within your own website. For example:

<a href="about.html">About us</a>

This will create a link that says "About us" and will take you to the about.html page in your website folder when you click on it.
