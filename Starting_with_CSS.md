Q1. What is CSS and why we use it?

Ans1. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language that defines how HTML elements are displayed on a web page. We use CSS to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other aspects of the web design.


Q2. What are the different ways to bring CSS into a HTML file?
Ans2. There are three main ways to bring CSS into a HTML file: inline, internal and external. Inline CSS means adding style attributes to individual HTML elements. Internal CSS means using a <style> tag inside the <head> section of the HTML document. External CSS means linking to a separate .css file using a <link> tag in the <head> section of the HTML document.
  
  
  Q3. What do you mean by specificity in CSS?
  
  Ans3. Specificity in CSS is a way of determining which style rules apply to an element. It is based on a point system that assigns different values to selectors depending on their complexity. The more specific a selector is, the higher its point value and the higher its priority. For example, an ID selector has a higher specificity than a class selector, and a class selector has a higher specificity than a tag selector. Specificity helps to avoid conflicts and ensure consistency in the appearance of web pages.
