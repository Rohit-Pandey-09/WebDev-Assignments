Q1. What is a Database? Explain with an example of why should we need a database?

Ans1. A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
One example of why we need a database is to manage customer information for an e-commerce website. Without a database, it would be difficult to keep track of customer orders, shipping information, and payment details. A database allows this information to be stored and retrieved quickly and easily, making it possible for the website to process orders and provide a better user experience.


Q2. Write a short note on file based storage system. Explain the major challenges of a File-based storage system.

Ans2. A file-based storage system is a system of storing data in a hierarchical structure that uses files and folders, much like a paper-based filing system with file cabinets and drawers.
One major challenge of it is data redundancy, where the same data is stored in multiple locations. This can lead to inconsistencies and make it difficult to keep data up-to-date.


Q3. What is DBMS? What was the need for DBMS?

Ans3. A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software tool used to organize, create, retrieve, update, and manage data in a database. The main aim of a DBMS is to provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is both convenient and efficient.


Q4. Explain 5 challenges of a file based storage system which was tackled by DBMS?

Ans4. i) Data Redundancy, ii) Lack of support for complex queries and data recovery, iii) Difficulty in managing data access, iv) 
Difficulty in maintaining data consistency, v) Difficulty in managing changes to the data structure.


Q5. List out the different types of classification in DBMS and explain them in depth.

Ans5. Classification in DBMS is a way of organizing data into different categories based on some criteria. There are different types of classification in DBMS, such as:

- Hierarchical: This type of classification arranges data in a tree-like structure, where each node has a parent node and zero or more child nodes. For example, a company's organizational chart can be represented as a hierarchical classification.
- Relational: This type of classification stores data in tables, where each table has a set of attributes and each row represents a record. For example, a student database can be represented as a relational classification.
- Network: This type of classification allows data to have multiple parent nodes and multiple child nodes, forming a network-like structure. For example, a social media platform can be represented as a network classification.
- Object-oriented: This type of classification treats data as objects, which have properties and methods. For example, a car can be represented as an object-oriented classification.


Q6. What is the significance of data modelling and explain the types of data modelling.

Ans6. Data modelling is a way of organizing and representing data in a system. It helps to understand the data better and to design efficient solutions for data processing. There are different types of data modelling, such as conceptual, logical and physical. Conceptual data modelling describes the entities and relationships in a domain, without focusing on the details. Logical data modelling defines the attributes and constraints of the entities and relationships, and maps them to a specific data model. Physical data modelling specifies how the data is stored and accessed in a database or a file system.


Q7. Explain 3 schema architecture along with its advantages.

Abs7. - It allows different users to have different views of the same data according to their needs.
- It makes it easier to change the logical or physical structure of the database without affecting the other levels.
- It hides the implementation details and internal workings of the database from the users.
