Q1. Why do we start learning a programming language with "Hello, World!"?
Ans1. We often start learning a programming language with "Hello, World!" because it is a simple and universal way to test if our code works and if we can communicate with the computer. By writing a few lines of code that display a message on the screen, we can see if we have installed the language correctly, if we understand its syntax and structure, and if we can run and debug our program. "Hello, World!" is also a friendly and welcoming greeting that expresses our curiosity and excitement about learning a new skill.


Q2. What is the use of comments and how do you write a comment in HTML?
Ans2. Comments are useful for adding notes or explanations to your HTML code. They can help you and other developers understand the structure and purpose of your code. Comments are not displayed in the browser, so they do not affect the appearance of your web page. To write a comment in HTML, you use the syntax <!-- comment -->, where comment is the text you want to include.


Q3. What are elements, tags, attributes, and the difference between them?
Ans3. Elements, tags, and attributes are the basic components of HTML. Elements are the building blocks of a web page, and they contain the content and structure of the page. Tags are used to define and identify the elements, and they are surrounded by angle brackets (< and >). Attributes are used to provide additional information about the elements, such as their style or behavior, and they are placed inside the opening tag of an element.


Q4. Briefly explain what HTML entities are?
Ans4. HTML entities are special characters that are used to represent symbols or characters that are not part of the standard HTML character set. For example, HTML entities can be used to display reserved characters like < and > without breaking the HTML code, or to display characters from other alphabets or languages that are not supported by the default encoding. HTML entities start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;), and can be either named or numeric. For example, &lt; is the named entity for the less-than sign (<), and &#169; is the numeric entity for the copyright symbol (Â©).
